# `fwbox`

Collection of shell (bash/dash/ksh/ash/busybox/...) functions to implement a
chosen action on a range of platforms:

- Toggle a GPIO pin
- Load a firmware using a selected tool
- Trigger a signal capture
- Take a picture using a local camera

In combination with a configuration file, this allows to control a large range
of heterogene hardware with an uniform interface.
